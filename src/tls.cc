// This file contains helper functions for thread-local storage (TLS).
// TLS is probably the most obscure feature the linker has to support,
// so I'll explain it in detail in this comment.
//
// TLS is a per-thread storage. Thread-local variables (TLVs) are in a TLS
// so that each thread has its own set of thread-local variables. Taking
// an address of a TLV returns a unique value for each thread. For example,
// `&foo` for the following code returns different pointer values for
// different threads.
//
//   thread_local int foo;
//
// TLV is a relatively new feature. C for example didn't provide the
// official support for it through the keyword `thread_local` until C11.
// TLV needs a coordination between the compiler, the linker and the
// runtime to work correctly.
//
// An ELF exectuable or a shared library using TLV contains a "TLS template
// image" in the PT_TLS segment. For each newly created thread including the
// initial one, the runtime allocates a contiguous memory for an executable
// and its depending shared libraries and copies template images there. That
// per-thread memory is called the "initial TLS block". After allocating and
// initializing the initial TLS block, the runtime sets a register to refer
// to the initial TLS block, so that the thread-local variables are
// accessible relative to the register.
//
// The register referring to the per-thread storage is called the Thread
// Pointer (TP). TP is part of the thread's context. When the kernel
// scheduler switches threads, TP is saved and restored automatically just
// like other registers are.
//
// The TLS template image is read-only. It contains TLVs' initial values
// for new threads, and no one writes to it at runtime.
//
// Now, let's think about how to access a TLV. We need to know the TLV's
// address to access it which can be done in several different ways as
// follows:
//
//  1. If we are creating an executable, we know the exact size of the TLS
//     template image we are creating, and we know where the TP will be set
//     to after the template is copied to the initial TLS block. Therefore,
//     the TP-relative address of a TLV in the main executable is known at
//     link-time. That means, computing a TLV's address can be as easy as
//     `add %dst, %tp, <link-time constant>`.
//
//  2. If we are creating a shared library, we don't exactly know where
//     its TLS template image will be copied to in terms of the
//     TP-relative address, because we don't know how large the main
//     executable's and other libraries' TLS template images are. Only the
//     runtime knows the exact TP-relative address.
//
//     We can solve the problem with an indirection. Specifically, for
//     each TLV whose TP-relative address is known only at process startup
//     time, we create a GOT entry to store its TP-relative address. We
//     then emit a dynamic relocation to let the runtime to fill the GOT
//     entry with a TP-relative address.
//
//     Computing a TLV address in this scheme needs at least two machine
//     instructions in most ISAs; the first instruction loads a value from
//     the GOT entry, and the second one adds the loaded value to TP.
//
//  3. Now, think about libraries that are dynamically loaded with dlopen.
//     The TLS block for such library may not be allocated next to the
//     initial TLS block, so we can have two or more discontiguous TLS
//     blocks. There's no easy formula to compute an address of a TLV in a
//     separate TLS block.
//
//     The address of a TLV in a separate TLS block can be obtained by
//     calling the libc-provided function, __tls_get_addr(). The function
//     takes two arguments; a module ID to identify the ELF file and the
//     TLV's offset within the ELF file's TLS template image. Accessing a
//     TLV is sometimes compiled to a function call! The module ID and the
//     offset are usually stored to GOT as two consecutive words.
//
// 1) is called the Local Exec access model. 2) is Initial Exec, and 3) is
// General Dynamic.
//
// There's another little trick that the compiler can use if it knows two
// TLVs are in the same ELF file (usually in the same file as the code is).
// In this case, we can call __tls_get_addr() only once with the module ID
// and the offset 0 to obtain the base address of the ELF file's TLS block.
// The base address obtained this way is sometimes called Dynamic Thread
// Pointer or DTP. We can then compute TLVs' addresses by adding their
// DTP-relative addresses to DTP. This access model is called the Local
// Dynamic.
//
// The compiler tries to emit the most efficient code for a TLV access based
// on compiler command line options and TLV properties as follows:
//
//  1. If -fno-PIC or -fPIE is given, and a TLV is defined as a file-local
//     variable, the compiler knows that it is compiling code for an
//     executable (i.e. not for a shared library) and the TLV is defined
//     within the executable. In this case, Local Exec is used to access the
//     variable.
//
//  2. If -fno-PIC or -fPIE is given (i.e. the compiler is compiling code for
//     a main executable), but a TLV is defined in another translation unit,
//     then the variable may be defined not in the main executable but in a
//     shared library. In this case, Initial Exec is used to access the
//     variable.
//
//  3. If -fPIC is given, it may be compiling code for dlopen'able shared
//     library. In this case, Local Dynamic or General Dynamic is used to
//     access TLVs.
//
// You can also manually control how the compiler emits TLV access code
// globally with `-ftls-model=<model-name>` or per-variable basis with
// `__attribute__((tls_model(<model-name>)))`. For example, if you are
// building a shared library that you have no plan to use with dlopen(), you
// may want to compile the source files with `-ftls-model=initial-exec` to
// avoid the cost associated with the General Dynamic access model.
//
// The linker may rewrite instructions with a code sequence for a cheaper
// access model at link-time.
//
// === TLS Descriptor access model ===
//
// As described above, there are arguably too many different TLS access
// models from the most generic one you can use in any ELF file to the most
// efficient one you can use only when building a main executable. Compiling
// source code with an appropriate TLS access model is bothersome. To solve
// the problem, a new TLS access model was proposed. That is called the TLS
// Descriptor (TLSDESC) model.
//
// For a TLV compiled with TLSDESC, we allocate two consecutive GOT slots
// and create a TLSDESC dynamic relocation for them. The dynamic linker
// sets a function pointer to the first GOT slot and its argument to the
// second slot.
//
// To access the TLV, we call the function pointer with the argument we
// read from the second GOT slot. The function returns the TLV's
// TP-relative address.
//
// The runtime chooses the best access method depending on the situation
// and sets a pointer to the most efficient code to the first GOT slot.
// For example, if a TLV's TP-relative address is known at process startup
// time, the runtime sets that address to the second GOT slot and set a
// function that just returns its argument to the first GOT slot.
//
// With TLSDECS, the compiler can always emit the same code for TLVs
// without sacrificing runtime performance.
//
// TLSDESC is better than the traditional, non-TLSDESC TLS access models.
// It's the default on ARM64, but on other targets, TLSDESC is
// unfortunately either optional or even not supported at all. So we still
// need to support both the traditional TLS models and the TLSDESC model.
