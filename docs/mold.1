.Ss Compatibility
.Nm
is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU linkers for linking user\
-land programs.
If your user-land program cannot be built due to missing command-line options, \
please file a bug at
.Lk https://github.com/rui314/mold/issues .
.
.Pp
.Nm
supports a very limited set of linker script features,
which is just sufficient to read
.Pa /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so
on Linux systems (on Linux, that file is despite its name not a shared \
library but an ASCII linker script that loads a real
.Pa libc.so
file.)
Beyond that, we have no plan to support any linker script features.
The linker script is an ad-hoc, over-designed, complex language which \
we believe needs to be disrupted by a simpler mechanism.
We have a plan to add a replacement for the linker script to
.Nm
instead.
.
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss Archive symbol resolution
Traditionally, Unix linkers are sensitive to the order in which input files \
appear on command line.
They process input files from the first (left-most) file to the \
last (right-most) file one-by-one.
While reading input files, they maintain sets of defined and \
undefined symbols.
When visiting an archive file
.Pf ( Li \.a
files), they pull out object files to resolve as many undefined symbols as \
possible and go on to the next input file.
Object files that weren't pulled out will never have a chance for a second look.
.
.Pp
Due to this semantics, you usually have to add archive files at the end of a \
command line, so that when a linker reaches archive files, it knows what \
symbols are remain undefined.
If you put archive files at the beginning of a command line, a linker doesn't \
have any undefined symbol, and thus no object files will be pulled out from \
archives.
.
.Pp
You can change the processing order by
.Fl -start-group
and
.Fl -end-group
options, though they make a linker slower.
.
.Pp
.Nm
as well as LLVM
.Xr lld 1
linker take a different approach.
They memorize what symbols can be resolved from archive files instead of \
forgetting it after processing each archive.
Therefore,
.Nm
and
.Xr lld 1
can "go back" in a command line to pull out object files from archives,
if they are needed to resolve remaining undefined symbols.
They are not sensitive to the input file order.
.
.Pp
.Fl -start-group
and
.Fl -end-group
are still accepted by
.Nm
and
.Xr lld 1
for compatibility with traditional linkers,
but they are silently ignored.
.
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss Dynamic symbol resolution
Some Unix linker features are unable to be understood without understanding \
the semantics of dynamic symbol resolution.
Therefore, even though that's not specific to
.Nm ,
we'll explain it here.
.Pp
We use "ELF module" or just "module" as a collective term to refer an
executable or a shared library file in the ELF format.
.Pp
An ELF module may have lists of imported symbols and exported symbols,
as well as a list of shared library names from which imported symbols
should be imported.
The point is that imported symbols are not bound to any specific shared \
library until runtime.
.Pp
Here is how the Unix dynamic linker resolves dynamic symbols.
Upon the start of an ELF program, the dynamic linker construct a list of ELF \
modules which as a whole consist of a complete program.
The executable file is always at the beginning of the list followed \
by its depending shared libraries.
An imported symbol is searched from the beginning of the list to the end.
If two or more modules define the same symbol, the one that appears first in \
the list takes precedence over the others.
.Pp
This Unix semantics are contrary to systems such as Windows that have the \
two-level namespace for dynamic symbols.
On Windows, for example, dynamic symbols are represented as a tuple of
.Pq Sy symbol-name , shared-library-name ,
so that each dynamic symbol is guaranteed to be resolved from some specific \
library.
.Pp
Typically, an ELF module that exports a symbol also imports the same symbol.
Such a symbol is usually resolved to itself, but that's not the case if a \
module that appears before in the symbol search list provides another \
definition of the same symbol.
.Pp
Let me take
.Xr malloc 3
as an example.
Assume that you define your version of
.Xr malloc 3
in your main executable file.
Then, all
.Sy malloc
calls from any module are resolved to your function instead of that in libc,
because the executable is at the beginning of the dynamic symbol search list.
Note that even
.Xr malloc 3
calls within libc are resolved to your definition since libc exports and imports
.Sy malloc .
Therefore, by defining
.Sy malloc
yourself, you can overwrite a library function, and the
.Xr malloc 3
in libc becomes dead code.
.Pp
Thess Unix semantics are tricky and sometimes considered harmful.
For example, assume that you accidentally define
.Xr atoi 3
as a global function in your executable that behaves completely differently \
from the one in the C standard.
Then, all
.Sy atoi
function calls from any modules (even function calls within libc) are \
redirected to your function instead of the one in libc which obviously causes \
a problem.
That is a somewhat surprising consequence for an accidental name conflict.
On the other hand, this semantic is sometimes considered useful because it \
allows users to overwrite library functions without recompiling modules \
containing them.
Whether good or bad, you should keep this semantic in mind to understand the \
Unix linkers behaviors.
.
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss Build reproducibility
.Nm Ap s
output is deterministic.
That is, if you pass the same object files and the same command-line options to
the same version of
.Nm ,
it is guaranteed that the output is always bit-wise the same.
The linker's internal randomness, such as the timing of thread scheduling or \
iteration orders of hash tables, doesn't affect the output.
.
.Pp
.Nm
does not have any host-specific default settings.
This is contrary to the GNU linkers to which some configurable values, \
such as system-dependent library search paths, are hard-coded.
.Nm
depends only on its command-line arguments.
.
.\"=============================================================================
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It Fl -help
Report usage information to stdout and exit.
.
.It Fl v , Fl -version
Report version information to stdout.
.
.It Fl V
Report version and target information to stdout.
.
.It Fl C Ar dir , Fl -directory Ar dir
Change to
.Ar dir
before doing anything.
.
.It Fl E , Fl -export-dynamic , Fl -no-export-dynamic
When creating an executable, using the
.Fl E
option causes all global symbols to be put into the dynamic symbol table,
so that the symbols are visible from other ELF modules at runtime.
.Pp
By default, or if
.Fl -no-export-dynamic
is given, only symbols
that are referenced by DSOs at link-time are exported from an executable.
.
.It Fl F Ar libname , Fl -filter Ns = Ns Ar libname
Set the
.Dv DT_FILTER
dynamic section field to
.Ar libname .
.
.It Fl I Ns Ar file , Fl -dynamic-linker Ns = Ns Ar file , Fl -no-dynamic-linker
Set the dynamic linker path to
.Ar file .
If no
.Fl I
option is given, or if
.Fl -no-dynamic-linker
is given, no dynamic linker path is set to an output file.
This is contrary to the GNU linkers which sets a default dynamic linker path \
in that case.
However, this difference doesn't usually make any difference because the \
compiler driver always passes
.Fl I
to a linker.
.
.It Fl L Ns Ar dir , Fl -library-path Ns = Ns Ar dir
Add
.Ar dir
to the list of library search paths from which
.Nm
searches libraries for the \fB-l\fR option.
.Pp
Unlike the GNU linkers,
.Nm
does not have the default search paths.
This difference doesn't usually make any difference because the
compiler driver always passes all necessary search paths to a linker.
.
.It Fl M , Fl -print-map
Write a map file to stdout.
.
.It Fl N , Fl -omagic , Fl -no-omagic
Force
.Nm
to emit an output file with an old-fashioned memory layout.
First, it makes the first data segment to not be aligned to a page boundary.
Second, text segments are marked as writable if the option is given.
.
.It Fl S , Fl -strip-debug
Omit
.Sy \.debug_*
sections from the output file.
.
.It Fl T Ar file , Fl -script Ns = Ns Ar file
Read linker script from
.Ar file .
.
.It Fl X , Fl -discard-locals
Discard temporary local symbols to reduce the sizes of the \
symbol table and the string table.
Temporary local symbols are local symbols starting with
.Li \.L .
Compilers usually generate such symbols for unnamed program elements such as \
string literals or floating-point literals.
.
.It Fl e Ar symbol , Fl -entry Ns = Ns Ar symbol
Use
.Ar symbol
as the entry point symbol instead of the default
entry point symbol
.Sy _start .
.
.It Fl f Ar shlib , Fl -auxiliary Ns = Ns Ar shlib
Set the
.Dv DT_AUXILIARY
dynamic section field to
.Ar shlib .
.
.It Fl h Ar libname , Fl -soname Ns Ar libname
Set the
.Dv DT_SONAME
dynamic section field to
.Ar libname .
This option is used when creating a shared object file.
Typically, when you create
.Pf Sy lib Ar foo Ns Sy .so ,
you want to pass
.Fl -soname Ns = Ns Ar foo
to a linker.
.
.It Fl l Ns Ar libname
Search for
.Pf Sy lib Ar libname Ns Sy \.so
or
.Pf Sy lib Ar libname Ns Sy \.a
from library search paths.
.
.It Fl m Op Sy elf_x86_64 | elf_i386
Choose a target.
.
.It Fl o Ar file , Fl -output Ns = Ns Ar file
Use
.Ar file
as the output file name instead of the default name
.Sy a.out .
.
.It Fl r , Fl -relocatable
Instead of generating an executable or a shared object file, combine
input object files to generate another object file that can be used as
an input to a linker.
.
.It Fl s , FL -strip-all
Omit
.Dv \.symtab
section from the output file.
.
.It Fl u Ar symbol , Fl -undefined Ns = Ns Ar symbol
If
.Ar symbol
remains as an undefined symbol after reading all object files,
and if there is an static archive that contains an object file defining
.Ar symbol ,
pull out the object file and link it so that the \
output file contains a definition of
.Ar symbol .
.
.It Fl -Bdynamic
Link against shared libraries.
.
.It Fl -Bstatic
Do not link against shared libraries.
.
.It Fl -Bsymbolic
When creating a shared library, make global symbols export-only
(i.e. do not import the same symbol).
As a result, references within a shared library is always resolved locally, \
negating symbol override at runtime.
See
.Sx Dynamic symbol resolution
for more information about symbol imports and exports.
.
.It Fl -Bsymbolic-functions
Have the same effect as
.Fl -Bsymbolic
but works only for function symbols.
Data symbols remains both imported and exported.
.
.It Fl -Bno-symbolic
Cancel
.Fl -Bsymbolic
and
.Fl -Bsymbolic-functions .
.
.It Fl -Map Ns = Ns Ar file
Write map file to
.Ar file .
.
.It Fl -allow-multiple-definition
Normally, the linker reports an error if there are more than one \
definition of a symbol.
This option changes the default behavior so that it doesn't report an error \
for duplicate definitions and instead use the first definition.
.
.It Fl -as-needed , -no-as-needed
By default, shared libraries given to a linker are unconditionally added to \
the list of required libraries in an output file.
However, shared libraries after
.Fl -as-needed
are added to the list only when at least one symbol is actually used by an \
object file.
In other words, shared libraries after
.Fl -as-needed
are not added to the list if they are not needed by a program.
.Pp
The
.Fl -no-as-needed
option restores the default behavior for subsequent files.
.
.It Fl -build-id , Fl -no-build-id , Fl -build-id Ns = Ns Op Sy none | md5 | sha1 | sha256 | uuid | 0x Ns Ar hexstring
Create a
.Dv .note.gnu.build-id
section containing a byte string to
uniquely identify an output file.
.Fl -build-id
and
.Fl -build-id Ns = Ns Sy sha256
compute a 256-bit cryptographic hash of an output file and set it to build-id.
.Sy md5
and
.Sy sha1
compute the same hash but truncate it to 128 and 160 bits, respectively, \
before setting it to build-id.
.Sy uuid
sets a random 128-bit UUID.
.Sy 0x Ns Ar hexstring
sets
.Ar hexstring .
.
.It Fl -chroot Ns = Ns Ar dir
Set
.Ar dir
to root directory.
.
.It Fl -compress-debug-sections\fR=[\fInone\fR,\fIzlib\fR,\fIzlib-gabi\fR,\fIzlib-gnu\fR]"
Compress DWARF debug info
.Pf ( Sy .debug_*
sections) using the zlib compression algorithm.
.
.It Fl -defsym\ Ns = Ns Ar symbol Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar symbol
as an alias for
.Ar value .
.Pp
.Ar value
is either
an integer (in decimal or hexadecimal with
.Sq 0x
prefix) or a symbol name.
If an integer is given as a value,
.Ar symbol
is defined as an absolute symbol with the given value.
.
.It Fl -demangle , -no-demangle
Demangle C++ symbols in log messages.
.
.It Fl -dynamic-list Ns = Ns Ar file
Read a list of dynamic symbols from
.Ar file .
.
.It Fl -eh-frame-hdr , -no-eh-frame-hdr
Create
.Dv .eh_frame_hdr
section.
.
.It Fl -exclude-libs Ns = Ns Ar libraries Ns ...
Mark all symbols in the given
.Ar libraries
hidden.
.
.It Fl -fini Ns = Ns Ar symbol
Call
.Ar symbol
at unload-time.
.
.It Fl -fork , -no-fork
Spawn a child process and let it do the actual linking.
When linking a large program, the OS kernel can take a few hundred \
milliseconds to terminate a
.Nm
process.
.Fl -fork
hides that latency.
.
.It Fl -gc-sections , -no-gc-sections
Remove unreferenced sections.
.
.It Fl -hash-style Ns = Ns Op Sy sysv | gnu | both
Set hash style.
.
.It Fl -icf Ns = Ns Sy all , Fl -no-icf
Fold identical code.
.
.It Fl -image-base Ns = Ns Ar addr
Set the base address to
.Ar addr .
.
.It Fl -init Ns = Ns Ar symbol
Call
.Ar symbol
at load-time.
.
.It Fl -no-undefined

.It Fl -pie , -pic-executable , -no-pie , -no-pic-executable
Create a position-independent executable.
.
.It Fl -pop-state
Pop state of flags governing input file handling.
.
.It Fl -preload
Preload object files.
.
.It Fl -print-gc-sections , -no-print-gc-sections
Print removed unreferenced sections.
.
.It Fl -print-icf-sections , -no-print-icf-sections
Print folded identical sections.
.
.It Fl -push-state
Pop state of flags governing input file handling
.
.It Fl -quick-exit , -no-quick-exit
Use
.Dv quick_exit
to exit.
.
.It Fl -relax , -no-relax
Rewrite machine instructions with more efficient ones for some relocations.
The feature is enabled by default.
.
.It Fl -require-defined Ns = Ns Ar symbol
Like
.Fl -undefined ,
except the new symbol must be defined by the end of the link.
.
.It Fl -repro
Embed input files into
.Dv .repro
section.
.
.It Fl -retain-symbols-file Ns = Ns Ar file
Keep only symbols listed in
.Ar file .
.Pp
.Ar file
is a text file
containing a symbol name on each line.
.Nm
discards all local
symbols as well as global sybmol that are not in
.Ar file .
Note that this option removes symbols only from
.Dv .symtab
section and does not affect
.Dv .dynsym
section, which is used for dynamic linking.
.
.It Fl -rpath Ns = Ns Ar dir
Add
.Ar dir
to runtime search path.
.
.It Fl -run Cm command Ar arg Ar
Run
.Cm command
with
.Nm
as
.Pa /usr/bin/ld .
.
.It Fl -shared , -Bshareable
Create a share library.
.
.It Fl -spare-dynamic-tags Ns = Ns Ar number
Reserve given
.Ar number
of tags in
.Dv .dynamic
section.
.
.It Fl -static
Do not link against shared libraries.
.
.It Fl -stats
Print input statistics.
.
.It Fl -sysroot Ns = Ns Ar dir
Set target system root directory to
.Ar dir .
.
.It Fl -thread-count Ns = Ns Ar count
Use
.Ar count
number of threads.
.
.It Fl -threads , -no-threads
Use multiple threads.
By default,
.Nm
uses as many threads as the number of cores or 32, whichever is the smallest.
The reason why it is capped to 32 is because
.Nm
doesn't scale well beyond that point.
To use only one thread, pass
.Fl -no-threads
or
.Fl -thread-count Ns = Ns Sy 1 .
.
.It Fl -trace
Print name of each input file.
.
.It Fl -unique Ns = Ns Ar pattern
Don't merge input sections that match
.Ar pattern .
.
.It Fl -unresolved-symbols Ns = Ns Op Sy \
report-all | ignore-all | ignore-in-object-files | ignore-in-shared-libs
How to handle undefined symbols.
.
.It Fl -version-script Ns = Ns Ar file
Read version script from
.Ar file .
.
.It Fl -warn-common
.It Fl -no-warn-common
Warn about common symbols.
.
.It Fl -warn-unresolved-symbols , -error-unresolved-symbols
Normally, the linker reports an error for unresolved symbols.
.Fl -warn-unresolved-symbols
option turns it into a warning.
.Fl -error-unresolved-symbols
option restores the default behavior.
.
.It Fl -whole-archive , -no-whole-archive
When archive files
.Pf ( Sy .a
files) are given to a linker, only object
files that are needed to resolve undefined symbols are extracted from
them and linked to an output file.
.Fl -whole-archive
changes that behavior for subsequent archives so that a linker extracts all
object files and link them to an output.
For example, if you are creating a shared object file and you want to include \
all archive members to the output, you should pass
.Fl -whole-archive .
.Fl -no-whole-archive
restores the default behavior for subsequent archives.
.
.It Fl -wrap Ns = Ns Ar symbol
Make
.Ar symbol
to be resolved to
.Sy __wrap_ Ns Ar symbol .
The original symbol can be resolved as
.Sy __real_ Ns Ar symbol .
This option is typically used for wrapping an existing function.
.
.It Fl z Cm now , Fl z Cm lazy
By default, functions referring other ELF modules are resolved by the
dynamic linker when they are called for the first time.
.Fl z Cm now
marks an executable or a shared library file so that all dynamic
symbols are loaded when a file is loaded to memory.
.Fl z Cm lazy
restores the default behavior.
.
.It Fl z Cm origin
Mark object requiring immediate
.Dv $ORIGIN
processing at runtime.
.
.It Fl z Cm execstack , Fl z Cm noexecstack
By default, the pages for the stack area (i.e. the pages where local
variables reside) are not executable for security reasons.
.Fl z Cm execstack
makes it executable.
.Fl z Cm noexecstack
restores the default behavior.
.
.It Fl z Cm keep-text-section-prefix , Fl z Cm nokeep-text-section-prefix
Keep
.Dv .text.hot ,
.Dv .text.unknown ,
.Dv .text.unlikely ,
.Dv .text.startup
and
.Dv .text.exit
as separate sections in the final binary.
.
.It Fl z Cm relro , Fl z Cm norelro
Some sections such as
.Dv .dynamic
have to be writable only during an executable or \
a shared library file is being loaded to memory.
Once the dynamic linker finishes its job,
such sections won't be mutated by anyone.
As a security mitigation,
it is preferred to make such segments read-only during program execution.
.Pp
.Fl z Cm relro
puts such sections into a special section called
.Dv relro .
The dynamic linker make a relro segment read-only after it finishes its job.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
generates a
.Sy relro
segment.
.Fl z Cm norelro
disables the feature.
.
.It Fl z Cm separate-loadable-segments , Fl z Cm separate-code , Fl z Cm noseparate-code
If one memory page contains multiple segments,
the page protection bits are set in such a way that needed attributes \
(writable or executable) are satisifed for all segments.
This usually happens at a boundary of two segments with two different \
attributes.
.Pp
.Cm separate-loadable-segments
adds paddings between segments with different attributes so that they \
do not share the same page.
This is the default.
.Pp
.Cm separate-code
adds paddings only between executable and non-executable segments.
.Pp
.Cm noseparate-code
does not add any paddings between segments.
.
.It Fl z Cm defs , Fl z Cm nodefs
Report undefined symbols (even with
.Fl -shared ) .
.
.It Fl z Cm max-page-size
Some CPU ISAs support multiple different memory page sizes.
This option specifies the maximum page size that an output binary can run on.
If you specify a large value, the output can run on both large and small page \
systems, but it wastes a bit of memory at page boundaries on systems with \
small pages.
.Pp
The default value is 4 KiB for i386 and x86-64, and 64 KiB for ARM64.
.
.It Fl z Cm nodefaultlib
Make the dynamic loader to ignore default search paths.
.
.It Fl z Cm nodelete
Mark DSO non-deletable at runtime.
.
.It Fl z Cm nodlopen
Mark DSO not available to
.Xr dlopen 3 .
.
.It Fl z Cm nodump
Mark DSO not available to
.Xr dldump 3 .
.
.It Fl z Cm nocopyreloc
Do not create copy relocations.
.
.It Fl z Cm initfirst
Mark DSO to be initialized first at runtime.
.
.It Fl z Cm interpose
Mark object to interpose all DSOs but executable.
