.SH NAME
mold \- A Modern Linker

.SH SYNOPSIS
mold [\fBoptions\fR] \fIobjfile\fR \fB...\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmold\fR is a multi-threaded, high-performance linker that is
several times faster than the industry-standard ones, namely, GNU ld,
GNU gold or LLVM lld. It is developed as a drop-in replacement for
these linkers and command-line compatible with them with a few
exceptions.
.PP
Note that even though many userland programs, including large ones
such as Chrome and Firefox, can be built with \fBmold\fR, \fBmold\fR
is still very experimental. It supports Linux/x86-64 and Linux/i386.

.SS "How to use mold"
On Unix, \fBcc\fR (or \fBgcc\fR or \fBclang\fR, depending on what
compiler you use) is not just a C compiler but is actually a compiler
driver for various kinds of input files. \fBcc\fR dispatches based
on input file extensions. If you pass object files (\fB.o\fR files) to
a compiler driver, the linker command, which is usually installed as
\fB/usr/bin/ld\fR, is invoked as a backend.
.PP
To use an alternative linker, you have to modify a build config file
such as \fBMakefile\fR or \fBcargo.toml\fR to pass an appropriate
option to a compiler driver which invokes a linker. The problem is
that it is not always clear how to do that. In a complicated build
system, it can be very hard to figure out how to convince a system to
use a non-standard linker.
.PP
To deal with the situation, \fBmold\fR provides a convenient option to
force any build system to use \fBmold\fR. To use the feature, invoke
\fBmake\fR or a build command of your choice (such as \fBcargo
build\fR) as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    mold \-run make <make arguments if any>
.Ve
.PP
If you run a build command like above, the command runs under the
influence of \fBmold\fR so that when the command tries to run
\fB/usr/bin/ld\fR, \fBmold\fR is silently invoked instead.
.PP
Internally, \fBmold\fR invokes a given command with the
\fBLD_PRELOAD\fR environment variable set to its companion shared
object file. The shared object file intercepts all \fBexec()\fR-family
functions to run \fBmold\fR if \fB/usr/bin/ld\fR is attempted to be
run.
.PP
If you don't want to use the \fB\-run\fR option, and if you are using
\fBclang\fR, you can pass \fB\-fuse\-ld=/absolute/path/to/mold\fR to
\fBclang\fR to used \fBmold\fR. If you are using \fBgcc\fR, it looks
like there's unfortunately no easy way (other than \fB\-run\fR) to
force it to use \fBmold\fR, as \fBgcc\fR doesn't take an arbitrary
pathname as an argument for \fB\-fuse\-ld\fR.

.SS Compatibility
\fBmold\fR is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU linkers
for linking user-land programs. If your user-land program cannot be
built due to missing command-line options, please file a bug at
\fBhttps://github.com/rui314/mold/issues\fR.
.PP
\fBmold\fR supports a very limited set of linker script features,
which is just sufficient to read
\fB/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so\fR on Linux systems (on Linux,
that file is despite its name not a shared library but an ASCII linker
script that loads a real \fBlibc.so\fR file!)
Beyond that, I have no plan to support any linker script features.
The linker script is an ad-hoc, over-designed, complex language which
I believe needs to be disrupted by a simpler mechanism. I have a plan
to add a replacement for the linker script to \fBmold\fR instead.

.SS Archive symbol resolution
Traditionally, Unix linkers process input files from left to right as
they appeared in a command line. For each archive file, the
information about object files that were not pulled out is completely
discarded before a linker go on to a next input file.

Due to this semantics, you usually had to add archive files (\fB.a\fR
files) at the end of a command line, so that when a linker reaches
archive files, it knows what symbols are remain undefined. If you put
archive files at the beginning of a command line, a linker doesn't
have any undefined symbol, and thus no object files will be pulled out
from archives, and they will never be revisited again.

You can change the processing order by \fB\-\-start\-group\fR and
\fB\-\-end\-group\fR options, though they degrade the performance.

\fBmold\fR as well as LLVM \fBlld\fR linker take a different
approach. They memorize what symbols can be resolved from archive
files instead of forgetting it after processing each
archive. Therefore, \fBmold\fR and \fBlld\fR can "go back" in a
command line to pull out object files from archives, if they are
needed to resolve undefined symbols. They are not sensitive to input
file order.

\fB\-\-start\-group\fR and \fB\-\-end\-group\fR are still accepted
by \fBmold\fR and \fBlld\fR for compatibility with traditional linkers,
but they are silently ignored.
